### Who am I

An innovator by nature, who wants to break the conventional ways of web designing. Exposure to fields like Design to Technology and Psychology changed my views of seeing the world. I love seeing technology in terms of design and interaction. This vision reflects in all of my projects and ideas.

Experimenting and exploring is my way of life. In short, I do what I love and I love what I do.
